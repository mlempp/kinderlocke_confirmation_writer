# kinderlocke_confirmation_writer


This is a automatic conformation writer coded for kinderlocke.de. It uses a defined list of orders to generate a order confirmation in form of a predefined .docx file. 
The order list is not provided here because of data security reasons. A template can be requested. The GUI is coded in python and compiled for the final usage with pyinstaller.

The repository consists of two parts, the uncompiled python part and the compiled part for machine execution.
Based on customer specifications, this is a 32bit version.
